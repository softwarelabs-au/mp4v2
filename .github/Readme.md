[![Last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/softwarelabs-au/mp4v2.svg)](https://github.com/softwarelabs-au/mp4v2/commits/main) [![Last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/softwarelabs-au/mp4v2)](https://github.com/softwarelabs-au/mp4v2/releases)

The MP4v2 library provides an API to create and modify MP4 files as defined by ISO-IEC:14496-1:2001 MPEG-4 Systems. This file format is derived from Apple's QuickTime file format that has been used as a multimedia file format in a variety of platforms and applications. It is a very powerful and extensible format that can accommodate practically any type of media.
